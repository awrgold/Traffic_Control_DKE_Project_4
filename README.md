DKE project 2.2 - 2018

Phase 1 Description:
In the first phase, literature research is performed on modeling and simulation approaches. Attempt to include enough dynamics in your model such that congestion etc. occurs. Furthermore, preferably realistic data of the traffic density or flow is collected. Given a certain street plan, and a list of departure times, points of origin and destinations of drives, algorithms are designed that determine dynamically how to control the traffic and simulate how late each driver arrives. The output may contain measures such as the traveled distance and the amount of time that drives have been waiting etc. At the end of Phase 1 there should be at minimum a simple simulation environment, demonstrated by the case of special interest in a live demo, where only little to no dynamics and static control (e.g. a traffic light that cycles) are needed. Also, a draft introduction and literature reveiw for the final report is delivered. Obviously, you are most welcome to do more. An overview needs to be provided of which group member contributed to what and to which extent. 

Cars:

    Need origins, destinations, and a time frame to reach destination
    Need to detect collisions with each other
    Need to be able to remove themselves from the street once arriving at the destination

Streets: 

    Need stop lights (Green/Yellow/Red) that direct traffic

Research:

    Traffic control algorithms, flow network design, and literature regarding the study of traffic flow and density.
